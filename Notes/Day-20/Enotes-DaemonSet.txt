Deamonset ->

If we want that one monitoring pod must be running on all the nodes in the cluster for all the time, So we should not use RS / Deployment. 

DaemonSet ==> Number of replica(pod) ===  Number of nodes 
-------------------
Feature:  If we add new worker node in cluster then DS will automatically launch at newest one node.

-> It does not use RS / Deployment 
-> It wont deploy anything on MASTER NODE

	Worker Node  ==  Replica of pods
